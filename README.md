# PureBasic Project

For educational/demonstration purposes only.

Every directory under PureBasic directory is a separate sample project that you can use if you have a similar project.

Thanks!

I truly believe learning PureBasic is worth it more than Visual Basic.

## Compiling

To compile/run, just use the PureBasic IDE, that's very fast and simple for simple programs like these.
