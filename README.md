# PureBasic Project
For educational/demonstration purposes only.

Every directory under PureBasic directory is a separate 
sample project that you can use if you have a similar project.

Thanks!

I truly believe learning PureBasic is worth it 
more than other BASIC dialects.

The author of this language said that he will never 
add the concept of object.
And that is great. Other BASIC dialects added new things,
including those that were not meant 
to be for a BASIC language.

The reason why I am using this is to feel the BASIC language then.
And that is great, because when you want to do some
object-oriented programming, you do it in other languages, like Java.
I stay with the simplicity of PureBasic.

We also can take a look at C language. It is still the respectable
C language from the past. Other programming languages were built
from C with objects and classes. But C remained just like that.
My point here is, we want to retain the identity of different
programming languages.

So, in the end, PureBasic is one of the best BASIC dialect.

## Compiling
To compile/run, just use the PureBasic IDE, that's very fast 
and simple for simple programs like these.
