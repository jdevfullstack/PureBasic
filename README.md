# PureBasic
For educational purposes only

To compile/run, just use PureBasic IDE,
that's very fast and simple for simple programs like this.

This is far from complete, I don't have yet the time to complete this software.
I should add a module to check whether a student is already selected,
to prevent duplication of students, particularly when doing
random groupings.
