# miniScrabble
a scrabble game written in PureBasic

there are four sets
and when you click 'Reset'
your score will be counted

you better play this 
with a dictionary,
I intentionally not included any standard dict
so that learners/students will be engaged in 
playing this game doing some manual
researches for those words

To compile/run, just use PureBasic IDE, that's very fast and simple for simple programs like these.
